# 288 CST Developer Test
Technical test for prospective developers.

I have created a basic ASP.net web application of a shopping cart.

I found the task difficult, for several reasons. It is clear to me that I am capable and efficient at working within a project that I know well, but to start a project (even one as simple as this) from scratch is far outside my comfort zone. I used a template and followed a guide, but do not feel that this is a good example of my code.

The app has the basic ability to add to a cart from a choice of 3 products, varying quantities, and to add a discount to the whole cart. The discount code can be added in any format with a number eg "February20" and will simply strip the number for use.

Unfortunately unit testing is not something that I use in my current job. I tried to test the controller methods, but stumbled when trying to mock the session. I have therefore unfortunately been unable to include any tests.

What I lack in current knowledge and ability, I make up for in enthusiasm to learn. I hope this was clear from the first interview.

Changes / improvements that I would make are as follows:

Create a database to store the products and discount codes.
Create a frontend - I have used Razor as this was included within the template I used, but is not something I have used before.
Start again with some guidance and a deeper understanding of the required approach. Unfortunately I cannot spend any more time on this at the moment.
Write unit tests, and learn how to mock the session.
